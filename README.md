# Hangman

The Hangman game written in Java

Hangman is a words guessing game for one player. This is command line application where user Input the answer while running the program. The program then prints out a row of dashes, one for each letter in the secret word, and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made seven incorrect guesses.
